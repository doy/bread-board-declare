Revision history for Bread-Board-Declare

{{$NEXT}}

0.14  2013-05-14
      - fix inheriting from classes which aren't yet loaded (reported by
        xenoterracide)

0.13  2013-03-07
      - fix for hash randomization in blead

0.12  2012-02-12
      - add explicit dep on Class::Load, since Moose didn't do that until 2.04

0.11  2012-01-26
      - dependencies can now be specified inline with the dep() function
      - type inference can now infer dependencies that are non-moose classes,
        and dependencies which are created by block injections (as long as the
        class is also specified)
      - Bread::Board::Declare classes can now specify subcontainers - see
        Bread::Board::Declare::Meta::Role::Attribute::Container and
        t/subcontainers.t for more details

0.10  2011-07-27
      - bump Bread::Board prereq due to a bug
      - allow specifying parameters for services
      - inferring services should just set up parameters, not die

0.09  2011-06-02
      - make sure coercions are run in all cases (rafl)

0.08  2011-06-01
      - allow inferring dependencies for constructor injection services
        (infer => 1 in the attribute definition)

0.07  2011-04-26
      - fix test suite for upcoming moose error message changes

0.06  2011-04-02
      - set the 'class' attribute on block services, so that circular
        dependencies can work better. (jasonmay)

0.05  2011-03-31
      - bump Bread::Board dep

0.04  2011-03-24
      - resolving dependencies for services should also check the type
        constraint on the associated attribute

0.03  2011-03-04
      - oops, i broke inlining for moose 2 at some point

0.02  2011-03-02
      - more useful handling of attributes that don't explicitly define a
        service: they will get a service that throws an exception if it is
        resolved, which allows the value of that service to be provided by the
        attribute.

0.01  2011-02-26
      - Initial release
